One of the key visual elements that help define its unique aesthetic is the stylized shadows—sharp, expressive, and carefully crafted to enhance the game’s atmosphere without aiming for photorealism.\n\u003Cbr>\u003C/br>\nIn this post, we explore how modern OpenGL techniques can be used to recreate these iconic cel-shaded shadows. \nBy combining traditional shadow mapping with toon-style lighting, we can capture that blend of realism and artistry that makes Zelda’s world so enchanting. Whether you’re a graphics developer or an enthusiast, diving into stylized shadows is a great way to deepen your understanding of both lighting and non-photorealistic rendering in real-time 3D graphics.","src/content/blog/Cel-Shading-in-Modern-OpenGL.mdx",[33,34],"../../assets/Cover/Posts/Cel-Shading-in-Modern-OpenGL/CoverLight.png","../../assets/Cover/Posts/Cel-Shading-in-Modern-OpenGL/CoverDark.png","923fcccb3d2fc0f5",true,"welcome",{"id":37,"data":39,"body":51,"filePath":52,"assetImports":53,"digest":56,"deferredRender":36},{"title":40,"description":41,"pubDate":42,"updatedDate":43,"heroLight":44,"heroDark":45,"tags":46,"readingTime":50},"Welcome to My New Website & Blog","Introducing this new space where I’ll share everything about game development, my projects, and the journey ahead.",["Date","2025-06-16T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2025-06-17T00:00:00.000Z"],"__ASTRO_IMAGE_../../assets/Cover/Posts/welcome/CoverLight.png","__ASTRO_IMAGE_../../assets/Cover/Posts/welcome/CoverDark.png",[47,48,49,24,21],"Introduction","Blog","Website","4 min read","import FeaturedInsight from '../../components/Widgets/FeaturedInsight.jsx';\n\n\u003CFeaturedInsight title=\"Note:\">\n  The layout of blogs can change at any time, because of evolving construction!\n\u003C/FeaturedInsight>\n\n## Hello and welcome to my brand-new website and blog!\n\u003Cbr>\u003C/br>\nThis space is where I’ll be sharing my journey through game development, engine programming, and everything in between. After years of working on projects like my custom game engine Vantor, experimenting with graphics, tools, and code, I wanted to create a dedicated hub to document progress, share insights, tutorials, and cool projects.\nHere, you can expect posts ranging from deep dives into engine architecture and rendering techniques to behind-the-scenes looks at what I’m building — whether that’s new features, optimizations, or tooling for game development. I also plan to share updates about my creative projects, and maybe some fun experiments along the way.\n\u003Cbr>\u003C/br>\nWhy a blog? For me, writing about what I do helps clarify ideas, track progress, and connect with others who share similar interests. Whether you’re a fellow developer, hobbyist, or just curious, I hope this becomes a place where knowledge and inspiration flow freely.\n\u003Cbr>\u003C/br>\nThank you for stopping by! If you’re excited about game development or curious about building engines and tools, stick around.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have questions, ideas, or just want to say hi. This website is just getting started, and I’m looking forward to growing with this blog together.\n\u003Cbr>\u003C/br>\n#### Stay tuned and happy coding!","src/content/blog/welcome.mdx",[54,55],"../../assets/Cover/Posts/welcome/CoverLight.png","../../assets/Cover/Posts/welcome/CoverDark.png","74cee5345c1d787a"]
